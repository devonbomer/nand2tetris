# Phony targets: .DEFAULT_GOAL(cam rim only one target at a time) .PHONY (define all targets that aren't files.)
# .PHONY will run recipe of all targets listed regardless of whether a file name exists or what it's last modification time is 
.PHONY: all say_hello generate clean

# .Phony doesn't count as the top target, so all will still be ran
all: say_hello generate

#	recipe

# @ sign suppresses outputing command. Still runs command

# clean should not be placed in all, and should be ran manually
